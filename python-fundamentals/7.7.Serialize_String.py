'''
You have been tasked to serialize a string. The serialization is done in a special way, in which a character from that string is saved with the indexes at which it is found.
The input will consist of a single input line, containing a single string, which may consist of ANY ASCII character. Your task is to serialize the string in the following way:
{char}:{index1}/{index2}/{index3}
The char will be the character, and the indexes, will be the indexes it is found at in the string.
Note: This problem is a string problem, and should ONLY use strings in its solution.
