This is how it works:

- if the try branch raises the exc1 exception, it will be handled by the except exc1: block;
- similarly, if the try branch raises the exc2 exception, it will be handled by the except exc2: block;
- if the try branch raises any other exception, it will be handle by the unnamed except block.
